# SQL Injection Prevention Implementation

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive SQL injection prevention measures implemented in the E-Commerce application.

## Security Measures Implemented

### 1. Prepared Statements
All SQL queries have been converted to use prepared statements through the `SecureDB` class:

- **Before**: `"SELECT * FROM products WHERE product_id = {$_GET['id']}"`
- **After**: `"SELECT * FROM products WHERE product_id = ?"` with parameter binding

### 2. Input Validation and Sanitization
Created `InputValidator` class with methods for:

- **Email validation**: `validateEmail()` - Uses PHP's FILTER_VALIDATE_EMAIL
- **Integer validation**: `validateInt()` - Validates with min/max ranges
- **Float validation**: `validateFloat()` - Validates numeric values with ranges
- **String sanitization**: `sanitizeString()` - HTML escapes and length limits
- **Phone validation**: `validatePhone()` - Validates phone number format
- **Search term validation**: `validateSearchTerm()` - Sanitizes search inputs

### 3. SecureDB Class
A wrapper class for database operations providing:

- **select()**: Secure SELECT queries with prepared statements
- **insert()**: Secure INSERT queries with parameter binding
- **update()**: Secure UPDATE queries with validation
- **delete()**: Secure DELETE queries with ID validation

### 4. Files Modified

#### Core Configuration
- `includes/config.php` - Added security includes and charset setting
- `admin/includes/config.php` - Added security includes
- `includes/security.php` - New security functions and classes

#### Authentication & User Management
- `login.php` - Secured login with email validation and prepared statements
- `admin/login.php` - Secured admin login
- `admin/users.php` - Secured user listing with pagination
- `admin/update-user.php` - Secured user updates with role validation
- `admin/remove-user.php` - Secured user deletion with ID validation

#### Product Management
- `admin/save-post.php` - Secured product creation with input validation
- `admin/update-post.php` - Secured product updates
- `admin/remove-post.php` - Secured product deletion
- `admin/post.php` - Secured product listing with pagination
- `admin/catagory.php` - Secured category queries

#### Search & Display
- `search.php` - Completely secured search functionality
- `functions/functions.php` - Secured helper functions

### 5. Key Security Features

#### Input Validation
```php
// Email validation
$email = InputValidator::validateEmail($_POST['email']);
if (!$email) {
    // Handle invalid email
}

// Integer validation with range
$product_id = InputValidator::validateInt($_GET['id'], 1);
if ($product_id === false) {
    // Handle invalid ID
}
```

#### Prepared Statements
```php
// Secure query execution
$sql = "SELECT * FROM products WHERE product_id = ?";
$result = $secureDB->select($sql, [$product_id], 'i');
```

#### Search Security
```php
// Sanitize search terms
$sanitized_terms = [];
foreach($search_term_array as $term) {
    $sanitized_term = InputValidator::validateSearchTerm($term);
    if ($sanitized_term !== false) {
        $sanitized_terms[] = $sanitized_term;
    }
}
```

### 6. CSRF Protection (Bonus)
Added `CSRFProtection` class for future implementation:

- Token generation and validation
- Helper methods for form integration

### 7. Error Handling
Improved error handling with:

- Proper validation before database operations
- Graceful failure handling
- Redirect with error messages instead of exposing system details

### 8. Database Connection Security
- Set UTF-8 charset to prevent character set confusion attacks
- Proper error handling for connection failures

## Testing Recommendations

### 1. SQL Injection Tests
Test the following attack vectors:

```sql
-- Union-based injection
' UNION SELECT 1,2,3,4,5--

-- Boolean-based blind injection
' AND 1=1--
' AND 1=2--

-- Time-based blind injection
'; WAITFOR DELAY '00:00:05'--

-- Error-based injection
' AND (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM information_schema.tables)>0--
```

### 2. Input Validation Tests
- Test with empty inputs
- Test with extremely long strings
- Test with special characters
- Test with invalid email formats
- Test with negative numbers where positive expected

### 3. Authentication Tests
- Test login with SQL injection payloads
- Test password reset functionality
- Test session management

## Maintenance Guidelines

### 1. Code Review Checklist
- [ ] All user inputs are validated
- [ ] All SQL queries use prepared statements
- [ ] No direct string concatenation in SQL
- [ ] Proper error handling implemented
- [ ] Input length limits enforced

### 2. Regular Security Audits
- Review new code for SQL injection vulnerabilities
- Test with automated security scanning tools
- Perform manual penetration testing
- Update security functions as needed

### 3. Future Enhancements
- Implement CSRF protection on all forms
- Add rate limiting for login attempts
- Implement proper session management
- Add logging for security events
- Consider implementing Web Application Firewall (WAF)

## Conclusion
The application now has comprehensive protection against SQL injection attacks through:

1. **Prepared statements** for all database queries
2. **Input validation** for all user inputs
3. **Proper error handling** to prevent information disclosure
4. **Secure coding practices** throughout the application

All previously vulnerable endpoints have been secured, and the codebase now follows security best practices for PHP web applications.
