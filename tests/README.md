# E-Commerce Testing Framework

This comprehensive testing framework is designed specifically for software maintenance and evolution scenarios. It provides different categories of tests to ensure your e-commerce application remains stable, secure, and performant as it evolves.

## Types of Tests Conducted

### Unit Testing
Unit tests focus on testing individual components, functions, or methods in isolation. These tests verify that each unit of code performs as expected without dependencies on external systems.

**What we test:**
- Input validation functions (email validation, password strength)
- Data sanitization and security functions (XSS prevention, SQL injection protection)
- Authentication logic (password hashing, session handling)
- Business logic calculations (price formatting, cart totals)
- Utility functions (string manipulation, array operations)

**Benefits:**
- Fast execution and immediate feedback
- Easy to identify the exact source of failures
- Provides confidence when refactoring code
- Serves as living documentation of expected behavior

### Integration Testing
Integration tests verify that different components work correctly when combined. These tests check the interactions between modules, databases, and external services.

**What we test:**
- Database operations (CRUD operations, transactions)
- Data persistence and retrieval
- Relationships between database tables
- Connection handling and error recovery
- Data integrity across multiple operations

**Benefits:**
- Catches issues that unit tests might miss
- Validates data flow between components
- Ensures database schema changes don't break functionality
- Tests real-world scenarios with actual data storage

### Functional Testing
Functional tests validate complete user workflows and business processes from end to end. These tests simulate real user interactions and verify that the entire system works as expected.

**What we test:**
- Complete user registration process
- Shopping cart operations (add, update, remove items)
- Checkout and order processing workflows
- User authentication and authorization flows
- Product search and filtering functionality

**Benefits:**
- Validates business requirements are met
- Tests the application from user perspective
- Catches integration issues across the entire system
- Ensures critical user journeys work correctly

### Performance Testing
Performance tests monitor system performance and detect performance regressions. These tests ensure that code changes don't negatively impact application speed or resource usage.

**What we test:**
- Database query execution times
- Page load times and response times
- Memory usage during operations
- Concurrent user scenarios
- Bulk data processing performance

**Benefits:**
- Prevents performance degradation during development
- Identifies bottlenecks before they reach production
- Ensures scalability requirements are met
- Provides baseline metrics for optimization

### Security Testing
Security tests validate that security measures remain effective and that new changes don't introduce vulnerabilities.

**What we test:**
- SQL injection prevention
- Cross-site scripting (XSS) protection
- Password security and hashing
- Session management security
- Input validation and sanitization
- File upload security
- Authentication and authorization

**Benefits:**
- Prevents security vulnerabilities
- Ensures compliance with security standards
- Validates security measures during code changes
- Protects user data and system integrity

## Testing Methodology

### Test-Driven Development (TDD) Support
The framework supports TDD practices by providing:
- **Fast feedback loops**: Unit tests execute quickly for immediate validation
- **Isolated testing**: Each test runs independently without side effects
- **Comprehensive assertions**: Rich assertion library for precise validation
- **Mocking capabilities**: Mock external dependencies for focused testing

### Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) Elements
While primarily using PHPUnit's structure, the tests incorporate BDD principles:
- **Descriptive test names**: Tests clearly describe expected behavior
- **Given-When-Then structure**: Tests follow logical flow patterns
- **User story validation**: Functional tests validate user requirements
- **Business logic focus**: Tests verify business rules and workflows

### Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) Integration
The testing framework is designed for CI/CD pipelines:
- **Exit codes**: Proper exit codes for build pipeline integration
- **Coverage reporting**: Automated coverage reports for quality gates
- **Parallel execution**: Tests can run in parallel for faster builds
- **Environment isolation**: Tests don't depend on external resources

### Risk-Based Testing Approach
Tests are prioritized based on risk and impact:
- **Critical path testing**: High-priority user workflows (checkout, payment)
- **Security-first testing**: Comprehensive security validation
- **Performance monitoring**: Continuous performance regression detection
- **Backward compatibility**: Ensuring updates don't break existing features

4. Run evolution tests when adding new features

### Continuous Integration
Add these commands to your CI pipeline:

```bash
# Quick feedback during development
php run-tests.php unit

# Full validation before merge
php run-tests.php all

# Performance monitoring
php run-tests.php performance

# Security validation
php run-tests.php security
```

### Test Data Management
- Tests use SQLite in-memory database for isolation
- Each test class sets up its own test data
- Helper methods provide consistent test data creation

## Customization

### Adding New Tests
1. Create test files in appropriate directories
2. Extend `TestHelper` class for common functionality
3. Follow existing naming conventions
4. Update test suites in `phpunit.xml` if needed

### Modifying Test Thresholds
Performance thresholds can be adjusted in:
- `PerformanceRegressionTest.php`: Performance limits
- `SecurityMaintenanceTest.php`: Security validations

### Database Configuration
Test database settings can be modified in:
- `bootstrap.php`: Test environment variables
- `TestHelper.php`: Database setup and seeding

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **PHPUnit not found**
   ```bash
   composer install
   ```

2. **Database connection errors**
   - Check database configuration in `bootstrap.php`
   - Ensure test database exists and is accessible

3. **Memory issues with large tests**
   - Increase PHP memory limit: `php -d memory_limit=512M run-tests.php`

4. **Slow performance tests**
   - Check if test database has sufficient data
   - Adjust performance thresholds if needed

### Getting Help
- Check test output for specific error messages
- Review `bootstrap.php` for environment setup
- Examine `TestHelper.php` for database configuration
